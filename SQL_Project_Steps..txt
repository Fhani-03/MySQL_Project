Developed a robust library management system using SQL to efficiently manage books, borrowers, publishers, and library branches. Designed and implemented database tables with appropriate relationships and constraints, including foreign key constraints with cascading updates and deletions. Created queries to handle various tasks such as tracking book loans, retrieving borrower details, and managing inventory across branches. Highlights include complex SQL queries to retrieve data such as branch-specific book copies, borrower loan history, and author-based book information.
